### Features

Ways to Relax consists of a home page, a 'Yoga' page, a 'Watsu' page, a 'Sign up for our Newsletter' page & a 'Thank you' for subscribing page.

The whole site is responsive and works just as well on mobile phones as desktop screens.

* There is a 'R' favicon in the browser tab for 'Relax'.

  ![favicon](readmeimages/rfavicon.png)

* The Header section includes the title: 'Ways to Relax - Mind, Body & Soul' as well as links to each of the other pages: 'Home', 'Yoga', 'Watsu' & 'Newsletter-Sign Up'. This is present on all pages of the site.

  ![Ways to Relax Title and Header](readmeimages/header.png)

#### The Home Page

The home page of 'Ways to Relax' highlights some of the many benefits of relaxing your body, mind & soul.

![Home Page Image](readmeimages/homepage.png)


#### The Yoga Page

At the top of the Yoga page, the benefits of yoga are stated.

![Benefits of Yoga](readmeimages/benefitsyoga.png)

Next, the site shortly describes five different types of yoga: Yin Yoga, Vinyasa Yoga, Ashtanga Yoga, Yin Yang Yoga and Yoga Nidra.

![Different Types of Yoga one of which is: Ashtanga](readmeimages/yogatype.png)

A wide variety of Yoga positions are shown in the Yoga Positions section. Each pose comes with a short description of what benefits can be attained through that pose as well as an image of the pose so it is easier for you to do it yourself.

#### The Watsu Page

The first section on this page describes what Watsu is and what are the benefits of Watsu.

![What is Watsu and some Benefits](readmeimages/whatiswatsu.png)

Next, 3 different Watsu excersises are displayed. A short description the excersise and some of the benefits followed by a picture of it in practice.

#### The Newsletter-Sign Up Page

On this page the user can sign up for a weekly newsletter from Ways to Relax. In this input form, the user is required to Enter a name and email address. Optional is a textarea where the user can tell more about themselves and their favorite way to relax. Pushing the 'Subscribe' button will take the user to the 'Thank You' page. The form itself is centered on a picture of a paper surrounded by sand and stones.

#### The Thank You Page

After subscribing to the 'Ways to Relax' newsletter, the user is taken to a page showing 'Thank you for subscribing to our newsletter!'. From here, the user can click any of the links in the header to return to the site.

### Colour Scheme

I wanted the color scheme to reflect natural colors and such that are related to relaxation. Calm and soothing tons reflecting sand or ground with green for plants and black for hightlights.

* `Antiquewhite` is used as the primary background color for the header section and text areas.
* `Darkgreen` is used for text areas, links in the header & footer and labels for the signup form.
* `Tan` is used for the general background color of the whole page.
* `Black` is used for the title and other headings.

  ![Ways to Relax Color Choice](readmeimages/colors.png)

### Typography

Two differenet fonts from Google Fonts were used for this site.

* For all titles or headings (black text) [Protest Strike](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Protest+Strike?query=protest+strike) was used. This is a bolder style with smooth curves and easy readablilty. 

* All text areas (darkgreen text - exception is links and labels) have [Protest Riot](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Protest+Riot?query=protest+riot). This is a smooth quill like style which reminded me of calligraphy.

#### Future Implementations

1. Add descriptions of how to do each pose in the Yoga page.
2. Create a new page for Mindfulness with similar layout that the user is used to.
3. Add a 'Nearby You' section where you can locate Yoga or other forms of relaxation via Googlemaps.

## Testing

Ways to Relax has been tested on: Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Safari.

With Dev Tools all standard screen sizes were tested to make sure the site looks good and is still readable. 

I had a couple of friends and my brothers test the website on their mobile phone just to make sure that it was not only working locally with me.

Links in the main menu take the user where expected. Links in the footer take you to the appropriate social media site.

The newsletter-sign up form requires a name and email address and when submitted, correctly takes the user to the 'Thank You' page.
